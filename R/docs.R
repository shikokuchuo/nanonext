#' Protocols (Documentation)
#'
#' @description Protocols implemented by \pkg{nanonext}.
#'
#' For an authoritative guide please refer to the online documentation for the
#' NNG library at <https://nng.nanomsg.org/man/>.
#'
#' @section Bus (mesh networks):
#'
#' **\[protocol, bus\]** The bus protocol is useful for routing applications or
#' for building mesh networks where every peer is connected to every other peer.
#'
#' In this protocol, each message sent by a node is sent to every one of its
#' directly-connected peers. This protocol may be used to send and receive
#' messages. Sending messages will attempt to deliver to each directly connected
#' peer. Indirectly-connected peers will not receive messages. When using this
#' protocol to build mesh networks, it is therefore important that a
#' fully-connected mesh network be constructed.
#'
#' All message delivery in this pattern is best-effort, which means that peers
#' may not receive messages. Furthermore, delivery may occur to some, all, or
#' none of the directly connected peers (messages are not delivered when peer
#' nodes are unable to receive). Hence, send operations will never block;
#' instead if the message cannot be delivered for any reason it is discarded.
#'
#' @section Pair (two-way radio):
#'
#' **\[protocol, pair\]** This is NNG's pair v0. The pair protocol implements a
#' peer-to-peer pattern, where relationships between peers are one-to-one. Only
#' one peer may be connected to another peer at a time, but both may send and
#' receive messages freely.
#'
#' Normally, this pattern will block when attempting to send a message if no
#' peer is able to receive the message.
#'
#' @section Poly (one-to-one of many):
#'
#' **\[protocol, poly\]** This is NNG's pair v1 polyamorous mode. It allows a
#' socket to communicate with multiple directly-connected peers.
#'
#' If no remote peer is specified by the sender, then the protocol willselect
#' any available connected peer.
#'
#' If the peer on the given pipe is not able to receive (or the pipe is no
#' longer available, such as if the peer has disconnected), then the message
#' will be discarded with no notification to the sender.
#'
#' @section Push/Pull (one-way pipeline):
#'
#' In the pipeline pattern, pushers distribute messages to pullers, hence useful
#' for solving producer/consumer problems.
#'
#' If multiple peers are connected, the pattern attempts to distribute fairly.
#' Each message sent by a pusher will be sent to one of its peer pullers, chosen
#' in a round-robin fashion. This property makes this pattern useful in
#' load-balancing scenarios.
#'
#' **\[protocol, push\]** The push protocol is one half of a pipeline pattern.
#' The other side is the pull protocol.
#'
#' **\[protocol, pull\]** The pull protocol is one half of a pipeline pattern.
#' The other half is the push protocol.
#'
#' @section Publisher/Subscriber (topics & broadcast):
#'
#' In a publisher/subscriber pattern, a publisher sends data, which is broadcast
#' to all subscribers. The subscriber only see the data to which they have
#' subscribed.
#'
#' **\[protocol, pub\]** The pub protocol is one half of a publisher/subscriber
#' pattern. This protocol may be used to send messages, but is unable to receive
#' them.
#'
#' **\[protocol, sub\]** The sub protocol is one half of a publisher/subscriber
#' pattern. This protocol may be used to receive messages, but is unable to send
#' them.
#'
#' @section Request/Reply (RPC):
#'
#' In a request/reply pattern, a requester sends a message to one replier, who
#' is expected to reply with a single answer. This is used for synchronous
#' communications, for example remote procedure calls (RPCs).
#'
#' The request is resent automatically if no reply arrives, until a reply is
#' received or the request times out.
#'
#' **\[protocol, req\]** The req protocol is one half of a request/reply
#' pattern. This socket may be used to send messages (requests), and then to
#' receive replies. Generally a reply can only be received after sending a
#' request.
#'
#' **\[protocol, rep\]** The rep protocol is one half of a request/reply
#' pattern. This socket may be used to receive messages (requests), and then to
#' send replies. Generally a reply can only be sent after receiving a request.
#'
#' @section Surveyor/Respondent (voting & service discovery):
#'
#' In a survey pattern, a surveyor sends a survey, which is broadcast to all
#' peer respondents. The respondents then have a chance to reply (but are not
#' obliged). The survey itself is a timed event, so that responses received
#' after the survey has finished are discarded.
#'
#' **\[protocol, surveyor\]** The surveyor protocol is one half of a survey
#' pattern. This protocol may be used to send messages (surveys), and then to
#' receive replies. A reply can only be received after sending a survey. A
#' surveyor can normally expect to receive at most one reply from each responder
#' (messages may be duplicated in some topologies, so there is no guarantee of
#' this).
#'
#' **\[protocol, respondent\]** The respondent protocol is one half of a survey
#' pattern. This protocol may be used to receive messages, and then to send
#' replies. A reply can only be sent after receiving a survey, and generally the
#' reply will be sent to the surveyor from which the last survey was received.

#' Transports (Documentation)
#'
#' @description Transports supported by \pkg{nanonext}.
#'
#' For an authoritative guide please refer to the online documentation for the
#' NNG library at <https://nng.nanomsg.org/man/>.
#'
#' @section Inproc:
#'
#' The inproc transport provides communication support between sockets within
#' the same process. This may be used as an alternative to slower transports
#' when data must be moved within the same process. This transport tries hard to
#' avoid copying data, and thus is very light-weight.
#'
#' **\[URI, inproc://\]** This transport uses URIs using the scheme inproc://,
#' followed by an arbitrary string of text, terminated by a NUL byte.
#' inproc://nanonext is a valid example URL.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Multiple URIs can be used within the same application, and they will
#'   not interfere with one another.
#'
#'   \item Two applications may also use the same URI without interfering with
#'   each other, and they will be unable to communicate with each other using
#'   that URI.
#' }
#'
#' @section IPC:
#'
#' The IPC transport provides communication support between sockets within
#' different processes on the same host. For POSIX platforms, this is
#' implemented using UNIX domain sockets. For Windows, this is implemented using
#' Windows Named Pipes. Other platforms may have different implementation
#' strategies.
#'
#' *Traditional Names*
#'
#' **\[URI, ipc://\]** This transport uses URIs using the scheme ipc://,
#' followed by a path name in the file system where the socket or named pipe
#' should be created.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item On POSIX platforms, the path is taken literally, and is relative to
#'   the current directory, unless it begins with /, in which case it is
#'   relative to the root directory. For example, ipc://nanonext refers to the
#'   name nanonext in the current directory, whereas ipc:///tmp/nanonext refers
#'   to nanonext located in /tmp.
#'   \item On Windows, all names are prefixed by \\.\ pipe\ and do not reside in
#'   the normal file system - the required prefix is added automatically by NNG,
#'   so a URL of the form ipc://nanonext is fine.
#' }
#'
#' *UNIX Aliases*
#'
#' **\[URI, unix://\]** The unix:// scheme is an alias for ipc:// and can be
#' used inter-changeably, but only on POSIX systems. The purpose of this scheme
#' is to support a future transport making use of AF_UNIX on Windows systems, at
#' which time it will be necessary to discriminate between the Named Pipes and
#' the AF_UNIX based transports.
#'
#' *Abstract Names*
#'
#' **\[URI, abstract://\]** On Linux, this transport also can support abstract
#' sockets. Abstract sockets use a URI-encoded name after the scheme, which
#' allows arbitrary values to be conveyed in the path, including embedded NUL
#' bytes. abstract://nanonext is a valid example URL.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Abstract sockets do not have any representation in the file system,
#'   and are automatically freed by the system when no longer in use. Abstract
#'   sockets ignore socket permissions, but it is still possible to determine
#'   the credentials of the peer.
#' }
#'
#' @section TCP/IP:
#'
#' The TCP transport provides communication support between sockets across a
#' TCP/IP network. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported when supported by the
#' underlying platform.
#'
#' **\[URI, tcp://\]** This transport uses URIs using the scheme tcp://,
#' followed by an IP address or hostname, followed by a colon and finally a TCP
#' port number. For example, to contact port 80 on the localhost either of the
#' following URIs could be used: tcp://127.0.0.1:80 or tcp://localhost:80.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item A URI may be restricted to IPv6 using the scheme tcp6://, and may be
#'   restricted to IPv4 using the scheme tcp4://
#'
#'   \item Note: Specifying tcp6:// may not prevent IPv4 hosts from being used
#'   with IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses, particularly when using a wildcard hostname
#'   with listeners. The details of this varies across operating systems.
#'
#'   \item Note: both tcp6:// and tcp4:// are specific to NNG, and might not be
#'   understood by other implementations.
#'
#'   \item It is recommended to use either numeric IP addresses, or names that
#'   are specific to either IPv4 or IPv6 to prevent confusion and surprises.
#'
#'   \item When specifying IPv6 addresses, the address must be enclosed in
#'   square brackets (\[\]) to avoid confusion with the final colon separating
#'   the port. For example, the same port 80 on the IPv6 loopback address (::1)
#'   would be specified as tcp://\[::1\]:80.
#'
#'   \item The special value of 0 (INADDR_ANY) can be used for a listener to
#'   indicate that it should listen on all interfaces on the host. A shorthand
#'   for this form is to either omit the address, or specify the asterisk (*)
#'   character. For example, the following three URIs are all equivalent, and
#'   could be used to listen to port 9999 on the host: (1) tcp://0.0.0.0:9999
#'   (2) tcp://*:9999 (3) tcp://:9999
#' }
#'
#' @section TLS:
#'
#' The TLS transport provides communication support between peers across a
#' TCP/IP network using TLS v1.2 on top of TCP. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
#' when supported by the underlying platform.
#'
#' **\[URI, tls+tcp://\]** This transport uses URIs using the scheme tls+tcp://,
#' followed by an IP address or hostname, followed by a colon and finally a TCP
#' port number. For example, to contact port 4433 on the localhost either of the
#' following URIs could be used: tls+tcp://127.0.0.1:4433 or
#' tls+tcp://localhost:4433.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item A URI may be restricted to IPv6 using the scheme tls+tcp6://, or IPv4
#'   using the scheme tls+tcp4://.
#' }
#'
#' @section WebSocket:
#'
#' The ws and wss transport provides communication support between peers across
#' a TCP/IP network using WebSockets. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported when
#' supported by the underlying platform.
#'
#' **\[URI, ws://\]** This transport uses URIs using the scheme ws://, followed
#' by an IP address or hostname, optionally followed by a colon and a TCP port
#' number, optionally followed by a path. (If no port number is specified then
#' port 80 is assumed. If no path is specified then a path of / is assumed.) For
#' example, the URI ws://localhost/app/pubsub would use port 80 on localhost,
#' with the path /app/pubsub.
#'
#' **\[URI, wss://\]** Secure WebSockets use the scheme wss://, and the default
#' TCP port number of 443. Otherwise the format is the same as for regular
#' WebSockets.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item A URI may be restricted to IPv6 using the scheme ws6:// or wss6://,
#'   or IPv4 using the scheme ws4:// or wss4://.
#'
#'   \item When specifying IPv6 addresses, the address must be enclosed in
#'   square brackets (\[\]) to avoid confusion with the final colon separating
#'   the port. For example, the same path and port on the IPv6 loopback address
#'   (::1) would be specified as ws://\[::1\]/app/pubsub.
#'
#'   \item Note: The value specified as the host, if any, will also be used in
#'   the Host: HTTP header during HTTP negotiation.
#'
#'   \item To listen to all ports on the system, the host name may be elided
#'   from the URL on the listener. This will wind up listening to all interfaces
#'   on the system, with possible caveats for IPv4 and IPv6 depending on what
#'   the underlying system supports. (On most modern systems it will map to the
#'   special IPv6 address ::, and both IPv4 and IPv6 connections will be
#'   permitted, with IPv4 addresses mapped to IPv6 addresses.)
#'
#'   \item This transport makes use of shared HTTP server instances, permitting
#'   multiple sockets or listeners to be configured with the same hostname and
#'   port. When creating a new listener, it is registered with an existing HTTP
#'   server instance if one can be found. Note that the matching algorithm is
#'   somewhat simple, using only a string based hostname or IP address and port
#'   to match. Therefore it is recommended to use only IP addresses or the empty
#'   string as the hostname in listener URLs.
#'
#'   \item All sharing of server instances is only typically possible within the
#'   same process.
#'
#'   \item The server may also be used by other things (for example to serve
#'   static content), in the same process.
